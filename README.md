## Project Title: My Personal Portfolio Website

Creating a personal portfolio is one of the most meaningful projects for any budding developer. This project is a clean, professional, and visually appealing personal portfolio website built using only HTML and CSS. It reflects not just technical skills but also creativity, personality, and individual branding.

The project begins with a fixed header that includes a custom-styled logo — “My Portfolio” — where the "M" is highlighted with a splash of color for a stylish first impression. On the right side of the navigation bar, users can find neatly spaced links to various sections such as Home, About, Portfolio, Blog, and Contact. There's also a "Let's Talk" call-to-action button that encourages potential clients or employers to initiate communication.

When you scroll down, the hero section or the "home" section catches attention with its beautifully designed layout. This part introduces Megha Sahu — a frontend developer from Bhubaneswar who is currently pursuing BCA at Centurion University. The profile picture is professionally framed in a circular, shadowed design, giving a soft and approachable feel to the introduction.

The text content is concise and relatable. The headline, “Hi, I’m Megha Sahu,” is paired with a sub-heading “Frontend Developer,” instantly letting the viewer know who she is and what she does. Below that, there’s a short personal introduction paragraph, which adds warmth and authenticity to the page by sharing where she is from and what she is passionate about — web development.

The user interface features two main call-to-action buttons: “Hire Me” and “See Projects.” These buttons are prominently placed and styled to stand out, encouraging user interaction. The hover effects enhance interactivity while maintaining a smooth user experience. The styling is modern and consistent throughout, with a primary color palette dominated by a sleek shade of purple that offers a balance of professionalism and creativity.

At the bottom of the content area, you’ll find social media icons linked to platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter. These icons are placed inside circular, glowing outlines that subtly animate on hover, adding a touch of motion to the static layout.

The CSS file complements the HTML structure with clean, responsive styling. Every element, from the navigation links to the button groups and the social icons, is precisely laid out using Flexbox. The background image of the home section is set to cover the full viewport height, creating a full-screen immersive experience.

What makes this project stand out is how it merges aesthetics with function. It’s not overloaded with unnecessary features — it’s simple, straight to the point, and beautifully presented. It speaks volumes about the developer’s eye for detail and design sensibility.

In conclusion, this personal portfolio website is more than just a web page. It’s a digital identity — one that showcases Megha’s skills, confidence, and readiness to step into the professional world of development. It’s the kind of project every student or early-stage developer should have in their toolkit.
